## Defining the problem statement

A Data Science project on prediction of people who were likely to survive during the Titanic crash.
In particular, I will be applying the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy.

## Collecting the data

Training data set and testing data set are given by Kaggle you can download from
kaggle directly.

## Exploratory data analysis

In the jupyter notebook you will see plots showing several analysis and decison's taking from insights
